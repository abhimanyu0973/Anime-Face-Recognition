Ayanami Rei is the "First Children" of the Marduk Report and the pilot of EVA-00. Shrouded in mystery, she is socially withdrawn and rarely shows emotion. Seemingly completely devoted to her duty as an EVA pilot, her only apparent human relationship being with Nerv commander Ikari Gendou.

However, Rei comes to know Ikari Shinji and after some initial mistrust they come to better understand each other, revealing more of Rei`s emotional side and helping Shinji trust others again.

The female lead of Nisekoi. She is the daughter of the lead of the Bee Hive Gangsters and is in a fake relationship with Ichijo Raku.

Chitoge is very smart and completely fluent in both English and Japanese despite growing up in America. She is half-Japanese. She is somewhat forgetful, aggressive and quick to attack someone who gets on her nerves. Once you get to know her though, she becomes very talkative and friendly.

She is very bad at cooking because she never measures ingredients and adds random things she thinks will make the dish taste better. She is very athletic as she can easily jump over the school's walls and swim 25 meters in a couple of seconds.

Ever since she was a child she has had a hard time making friends as others were afraid of her gangster family and as a result she had a cold demeanor toward people at the start of the series due to Claude's over protectiveness. This led her to create notebooks filled with information on classmates in an attempt to make friends.
